# SimpleProjects
Here I dump some simple stuff that I generate during my work, so I could reuse it later.

It is mish-mash of everything in Python, PoSH and other languages that I know.


You can download that stuff and use it for your sake.
But you must remember that these programs protected by 0BSD, or you may not remember, since it is just like WTFPL.

Basically you may do with my code anything you want, I don't give a damn.
